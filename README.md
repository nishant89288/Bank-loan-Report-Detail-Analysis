## 📌 Business Problem

Banks need a reliable way to track and monitor loan performance to make data-driven decisions.  
This project helps answer key business questions such as:

- How many loan applications are received (MTD / MoM)?
- What is the total funded loan amount and how does it change over time?
- How much amount has been received back from borrowers?
- What is the average interest rate and borrower DTI?
- What percentage of loans are **Good Loans vs Bad Loans**?
- Which states, purposes, and borrower profiles drive the most loan activity?
